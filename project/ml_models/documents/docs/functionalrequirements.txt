Agricure Requirements Specification

Functional Requirements (FR)
Functional requirements describe what the system should do — the features and services it must provide.

User Management
FR1: The system shall allow users (farmers, agronomists, extension workers) to register and create personal accounts.

FR2: The system shall authenticate users through a secure login system.

FR3: The system shall allow users to reset their passwords.

Image Upload and Disease Diagnosis
FR4: The system shall enable users to upload images of affected crops web applications.

FR5: The system shall process the uploaded image using a trained AI/ML model to detect and classify crop diseases.

FR6: The system shall display the diagnosis results to the user, including disease name, severity, and affected plant part.

Recommendation and Advisory System
FR7: The system shall generate data-driven recommendations for disease management and treatment based on diagnosis results.

FR8: The system shall integrate environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil type) to enhance the accuracy of recommendations.

FR9: The system shall notify users of preventive measures for common regional diseases based on predicted environmental risks.

Historical Data and Analytics
FR10: The system shall maintain a history of users’ crop diagnoses and recommendations.

FR11: The system shall visualize trends and analytics for farmers, indicating disease patterns and management outcomes over time.

IoT Integration
FR12: The system shall collect environmental data from connected IoT devices (e.g., soil moisture, temperature sensors).

FR13: The system shall use real-time IoT data to support disease prediction and advisory recommendations.

Admin and Model Management
FR14: The system shall allow administrators to manage users, reported issues, and system content.

FR15: The system shall enable administrators to update and retrain AI models with new image datasets.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs — its qualities and operational constraints.

Performance Requirements
NFR1: The system shall process disease detection and generate recommendations within 10 seconds of image upload.

NFR2: The system shall support at least 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

Security Requirements
NFR3: The system shall ensure secure user authentication using hashed passwords and secure session management.

NFR4: The system shall encrypt sensitive data transmissions using HTTPS/SSL protocols.

NFR5: The system shall protect AI model access and administrative controls via role-based access control (RBAC).

Usability Requirements
NFR6: The system shall offer a user-friendly, multilingual interface tailored for farmers with limited digital literacy.

NFR7: The mobile application shall be compatible with Android versions 8.0 and above.

Reliability and Availability
NFR8: The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime.

NFR9: The system shall provide an offline mode for diagnosis history access when network coverage is unavailable.

Scalability Requirements
NFR10: The system shall be scalable to accommodate future integration of additional crop types, regions, and IoT devices.

Maintainability
NFR11: The system’s AI models and datasets shall be updatable without requiring system downtime.

Compliance
NFR12: The system shall comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR or applicable national laws) to safeguard user and farm data.
